- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CorporateStereotype

- All of the repositories are explorations of quantum curcuit models.  The mathematical framework is based on a unique eqation that I call the Formula for Zero.  The formula is integrated with an custom  dynamic kernal module that extends AI ML LLM models that I call the ZeroSumGame (ZSG) Framework. ZSG is constructed using custom Prompt Engireed directives that deployable the ZSG to a live AI ML model.  For instance, I use it with Grok 3 and ChatGPT LLM models (all the time).

ZSG implements what I call as the "Eposidc Itervtive Workflow" (EIW). It's a prompt engineering guidane system.
