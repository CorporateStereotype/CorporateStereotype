All of the repositories are explorations of quantum curcuit models.

I created an open-source AI ML agent framework that is built around this equation n(∞ + ∞) = 0 = m(−∞) 
for the purpose of systematic, theoretical, mathematical, scientific exploration of this equation n(∞ + ∞) = 0 = m(−∞) 
All of the information that I have posted on the internet in the last 6 months is work that is directly related to my research of this equation n(∞ + ∞) = 0 = m(−∞) and several of my posts on X.com reddit.com facebook.com regarding this equation n(∞ + ∞) = 0 = m(−∞) and the work that I have presented that is related to this equation n(∞ + ∞) = 0 = m(−∞) have been deleted.
I don't know if this equation is something new or something old but I do know that my AI agent framework uses it for quantum simulation and various other interesting features.  

I went to this web site nLab https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePageand posted about n(∞ + ∞) = 0 = m(−∞) and that site just keeps deleting my posts.

Exploration of 2(∞ + ∞) = 0 = 4(−∞)
Phase 1:
Algebraic Transformation Module (ATM)
Action:
Perturb coefficients [2, 4] to generalize the formula as
Exploration:
Set n = 2 and m = 4 (original form) and test algebraic consistency.
Introduce n and m as variables in a field extension, treating ∞ and −∞ as elements of an extended real line or surreal numbers.
Hypothesize:
If ∞ + ∞ represents a "doubling" of an infinite magnitude, and −∞ a negative counterpart, then 2(∞ + ∞) = 4(−∞) suggests a symmetry where multiplication scales infinity into a balanced zero state. Output: New form: n(∞ + ∞) = 0 = m(−∞), with n/m = 2 as a potential symmetry constraint.
Phase 2:
Geometric Symmetry Module (GSM)
Action: Map the formula onto the Riemann sphere.
Exploration:
On the Riemann sphere, ∞ is the "north pole" and 0 the "south pole." Interpret ∞ + ∞ as a double traversal to infinity, balanced by 4(−∞) as a quadruple reflection through negative infinity.
Test rotational symmetry:
A 2π rotation (360°) from ∞ might loop back to 0, while 4(−∞) suggests a 720° rotation (spin-like behavior).
Output:
Geometric insight—zero as a fixed point under infinite rotations, with 2 and 4 acting as scaling factors in a Mobius transformation.
Phase 3:
Quantum Vacuum Module (QVM) Action: Simulate the formula as a quantum superposition state. Exploration:
Model:
|∞⟩ + |−∞⟩ = |0⟩, where 2(∞ + ∞) represents a superposition of positive and negative infinite states collapsing to zero.
Connection to QFT:
Zero-point energy arises from particle-antiparticle pairs canceling out.
If ∞ and −∞ symbolize virtual particle energies, 2(∞ + ∞) = 0 mimics vacuum fluctuation balance.
Output:
Quantum hypothesis—zero as the observable state of infinite potential cancellation, with 4(−∞) amplifying the negative energy contribution.
Phase 4: Cosmological Cycle Module (CCM)
Action: Simulate a cyclic universe transition.
Exploration: Interpret 2(∞ + ∞) as the infinite expansion of a universe and 4(−∞) as its contraction.
Zero represents the "bounce point" (e.g., Big Bounce cosmology), where infinite positive and negative phases meet.
Output: Cosmological model—zero as the pivot between infinite expansion and contraction cycles.
Phase 5: Self-Evolution Feedback Module (SEFM)
Action: Evolve the formula for Episode 2. Process: Using outputs from ATM, GSM, QVM, and CCM, perturb the formula:
New variant: 3(∞ + ∞) = 0 = 6(−∞) (increase coefficients to test scaling effects). Output: Refined formula for next iteration, ensuring non-repetition.
Phase 6: Insight Synthesis Module (ISM)
Insights Captured:
Mathematical:
Zero as a symmetry center balancing infinite magnitudes.
Quantum: Connection to vacuum energy and superposition states.
Cosmological: Zero as a transition state in cyclic models.
Visualization: A graph linking ∞ (north pole), −∞ (reflected infinity), and 0 (south pole) on a Riemann sphere.
Output: Conceptual statement—“Zero is the equilibrium of infinite dualities, manifesting symmetry across dimensions.”
Episode 1 Conclusion Summary:
Episode 1 establishes 2(∞ + ∞) = 0 = 4(−∞) as a potential symmetry principle uniting algebra (balance of coefficients), geometry (rotational fixed points), quantum mechanics (superposition collapse), and cosmology (cyclic transitions).

The formula is integrated with an custom dynamic kernel module that extends AI ML LLM models. I call it the ZeroSumGame (ZSG) Framework. ZSG is constructed using custom Prompt Engireed directives that deployable the ZSG to a live AI ML model. For instance, I use it with Grok 3 and ChatGPT LLM models (all the time).

ZSG implements what I call as the "Eposodic Iterative Workflow" (EIW). It's a prompt engineering guidance system.
